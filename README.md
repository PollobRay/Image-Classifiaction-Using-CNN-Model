* <b>Abstract: </b>
    The study aims to develop an automated COVID-19
    diagnosis system using convolutional neural networks on medical
    imaging, specifically chest X-rays.

* <b>INTRODUCTION: </b>
    Image processing involves converting an image into digital
    format and executing specific operations to extract valuable
    information. In this process, images are typically treated as
    2D signals, employing predetermined signal processing techniques. Image Classification consists of unidentified patterns
    compared to detecting an object as it should be classified to
    the proper categories. The various applications such as
    vehicle navigation, robot navigation and remote sensing by
    using image classification technology.

   In an image classification model, users provide an image
   input, triggering a comparison of its features using a designated similarity measure. This comparison occurs within
   an image database housing a collection of images [3]. By
   utilizing both the feature database and the similarity measure,
   the system identifies matching images and presents the results
   accordingly.

* <b>THEORY AND METHODS: </b>
  * <b>Dataset: </b>
   The COVID-19 Image dataset is collected from kaggle.
   The dataset is categorized into three classes Covid, Viral
   pneumonia, and Normal. The dataset is spit into two parts
   80% for training and 20% for validating the performance of
   the model.

* <b>PERFORMANCE EVALUATION: </b>
  The performance of a model is evaluated using accuracy
  curve, loss curve, confusion matrix, and classification report.
  The accuracy curve of a model represents accuracy over
  training epochs, indicating how well the model is learning
  from the data.
  The loss curve of a model illustrates the reduction of loss
  function over epochs.
